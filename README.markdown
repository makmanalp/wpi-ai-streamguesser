Stream Guesser Thingy
=====================
This is a homework project from WPI CS, assignment #3. It's about probabilistic
reasoning and by extension, machine learning. You train it with a stream of
comma delimited letters and it will form a certain probability model of how
letters should appear. Then, using that model, it tries to follow up on the
input data to generate the rest.

How to run
----------
You'll need PLT scheme.
* Get PLT at http://download.plt-scheme.org/
* If you want to use the gui, run DrScheme and load tests.ss.
* If you want to run it in the command line, try:
    > mzscheme -r tests.ss
